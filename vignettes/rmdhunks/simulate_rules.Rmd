The underlying simulations are run using `rxode2`, and as such we need an
`rxode2` system object. From that we can either simulate subjects or load them
from a file. Next we need to define a set of rules. These will be a set of
conditions and actions. At each evaluation time point the conditions are
evaluated.  When a condition is met the actions associated with that condition
are executed.  For example, if during a visit (an evaluation time point) the
trough PK is below a certain level (condition) we may want to increase the
dosing regimen for the next dosing cycle (action).

## Creating subjects

Subjects are expected in a data frame with the following column headers:

* `id` Individual subject id
* Names of parameters and iiv as specified in the `ini` section of the
  `rxode2` function specification
* Names of covariates used in the model.

`mk_subjects()` --- Creates subjects for simulation by sampling based on
between-subject variability and generating covariate information based on user
specifications. 

### Covariates

The `covs` input is a list with the following structure:

* type: Can be either "fixed", "discrete", or "continuous".
* sampling: This field is only needed for a "continuous" covariate ' type and can be either "random", "normal" or "log-normal".
* values: This field depends on the type and optional sampling above.
  * fixed: A single value.
  * discrete: A vector of possible discrete elements.
  * continuous, random: Two values the first is the lower bound and the second is the upper bound.
  * continuous, normal: Two values the first is the mean and the second is the variance.
  * continuous, log-normal: Two values the first is the mean and the second is the variance.
  
This examples shows the `SEX_ID` randomly sampled from the values specified,
`SUBTYPE_ID` fixed at a value, and `WT` sampled from a log-normal
distribution.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
covs = list(
  SEX_ID     = list(type     = "discrete", 
                    values   = c(0,1)),
  SUBTYPE_ID = list(type     = "fixed",
                    values   = c(0)),
  WT         = list(type     = "continuous",
                    sampling = "log-normal",
                    values   = c(70, .15))
)
```

## Rule-based simulations

`simulate_rules()` --- This will run simulations based on the rule definitions
below. 

### Rules

Rules are a named list where the list name can be a short descriptive label
used to remember what the rule does. These names will be returned as columns
in the simulated data frame.

 * `condition`: Character string that evaluates to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. When true the `action` portion will be triggered. For a list of objects available see the Rule-evaluation environment below.
 * `fail_flag`: Flag set in the `rule_id` column when the condition is not met (set to `"false"` if not specified).
 * `true_flag`: Flag set in the `rule_id` column when the condition is met (set to `"true"` if not specified).
 * `action`: This is what the rule will trigger can be any of the following: 
   * `type`:  This defines the action type and can be either `"dose"`,  `"set state"`, or `"manual"`.

Based on the `type` the `action` field will expect different elements. 

Dosing:

* `action`
  * `type`:  `"dose"`
  * `values`:     Character string that evaluates as a numeric vector  dosing amounts (e.g. `"c(3,  3,  3,  3)"`)
  * `times`:      Character string that evaluates as a numeric vector of times (e.g. `"c(0, 14, 28, 42)"`)
  * `durations`:  Character string that evaluates as a numeric vector of durations  (e.g. `"c(0, 0, 0, 0)"`, zero for bolus dosing)

Changing a state value:

* `action`
  * `type`:  `"set state"`
  * `state`:     Character string with the name of the state to set (`"Ac"`)
  * `value`:     Character string that evaluates as a numeric value for state (e.g. `"Ac/2"` would set the state to half the value of Ac at the evaluation point)

Manual modification of the simulation:

* `action`
  * `type`:  `"manual"`
  * `code`:  Character string of code to evaluate.

### Rule-evaluation environment

Beyond simple simulations it will be necessary to execute actions based on the
current or previous state of the system. For this reason,  when a `condition`
or elements of the action (e.g., the `values`, `times` and `durations` of a
dose action type) are being evaluated, the following objects will be available
at each evaluation point:

* outputs:    The value of each model output. 
* states:     The value of each named state or compartment.
* covariates: The value of each named covariate.
* subject-level parameters: The value of each named parameter.
* rule value: The last value the rule evaluated as.
* `id`: Current subject id.
* `time`: Current evaluation time. 
* `SI_SUB_HISTORY`: A data frame of the simulation history of the current subject up to the current evaluation point.
* `SI_subjects`: The subjects data frame.
* `SI_eval_times`: Vector of the evaluation times.
* `SI_interval_ev`: The events table in it's current state for the given simulation interval.
* `SI_ev_history`: This is the history of the event table containing all
  the events leading up to the current interval.
* `SI_ud_history`: This is a free form object the user can define or alter within
  the "manual"action type (ud-user defined, history). 

####  The following functions will be available:

* `SI_fpd`: This function will fetch the previous dose (fpd) for the given id
  and state. For example for the current `id` and the state `Ac` you would do
  the following:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SI_fpd(id=id, state="Ac")
```

### Time scales

You can include columns in your output for different time scales if you wish.
You need to create a list in the format below. One element should be `system`
with a short name for the system time scale. The next should be `details` which
is a list containing short names for each time scale you want to include. Each
of these is a list with a verbose name for the time scale (`verb`) and a
numerical conversion indicating how that time scale relates to the others. Here
we define weeks and days on the basis of seconds.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
time_scales = list(system="days", 
                details= list(
                  weeks = list(verb="Weeks",    conv=1/(60*60*24*7)),
                  days  = list(verb="Days",     conv=1/(60*60*24))))
```
