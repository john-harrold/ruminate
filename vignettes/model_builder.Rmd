# Introduction

The model building module ...


# Model catalog

The model catalog is built from the sources field of the configuration file. Each source has the following fields:

- `group`: This is how models will be grouped in the selection pulldown.
- `name`: Short name for the model: **NOTE that names need to be unique**.
- `description`: Verbose description of the model.
- `type`: Supported model types are `"nlmixr2lib"`, `"rxode2"` or `"NONMEM"`.
- `obj`: For the rxode2 type you need to also specify the name of the object that is created. 
This option is only used for the rxode2 type.
- `file`: For both rxode2 and nlmixr2 you need to specify a character string with a file path. This will be evaluated as an R command, so keep that in mind. If the file is not found it
will be skipped when the app loads.

## Model Library   

To include the {`nlmixr2lib`} library you can select the `"nlmixr2lib"` source type. You
can also control how these models are grouped:

```r
  - source:
      type:        "nlmixr2lib"
      group:       "Model Library"
```

## User defined models

User-defined models can be specified in either NONMEM or rxode2 formats. This 
example shows you how to specify models for both formats:

```r
  - source:
      group:       "User-defined Models"
      name:        "rxode2 User model"
      description: "User-defined rxode2 model"
      type:        "rxode2"
      obj:         "my_fcn"
      file:        'file.path(getwd(),"user_model.R")'
  - source:
      group:       "User-defined Models"
      name:        "NONMEM User model"
      description: "User-defined NONMEM model"
      type:        "NONMEM"
      obj:         ""
      file:        'file.path(getwd(),"user_model.ctl")'
```
