<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) is a simple and quick method for
evaluating the exposure of a drug. It allows you to evaluate things like
linearity and in vivo exposure. To illustrate this consider an antibody
given in a subcutaneous injection. The actual exposure profile a patient
might experience is given in the solid black line in the left panel. But
we don’t yet have the ability to sample in a continuous fashion. What we
might observer is given by the blue points.</p>
<p><img src="noncompartmental_analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="768"></p>
<p>Generally NCA will determine the following directly from the
data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Cmax</code> - Maximum observed concentration
(units=concentration)</li>
<li>
<code>Tmax</code> - The time where the maximum concentration was
observed (units=time)</li>
<li>
<code>AUC</code> - The area under the curve
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>c</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">units=time \times concentration</annotation></semantics></math>)</li>
<li>
<code>AUMC</code> - The area under the first moment curve
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>u</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>e</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>×</mo><mi>c</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">units=time^2 \times concentration</annotation></semantics></math>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are all based on observational data. So the
<code>Cmax</code> and <code>Tmax</code> will most certainly not be at
the actual maximum concentration but as long as we sample judiciously it
will give us a good approximation. Similarly, the calculated
<code>AUC</code> and <code>AUMC</code> will be different than the actual
values. To calculate the areas you need to dig back into your calculus
text books to the trapezoid method. Basically each sampling interval is
a trapezoid and the area of each is calculated and added up for all of
the <code>n</code> samples:</p>

<p>This can be done in Excel pretty easily. Depending on the data and
the analysis other properties can be calculated. For example we can
calculate the clearance, mean residence time, steady-state volume of
distribution and terminal half-life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clearance:

</li>
<li>Mean residence time:

</li>
<li>Steady state volume of distribution:

</li>
<li>Half-life: Terminal slope of the natural log of the data</li>
</ul>
<p>Properties like AUC and AUMC can also be be calculated using
extrapolation from the last time point to infinity to account for data
beyond the observations at hand. The subsequent values of clearance,
volumes of distribution, etc can also change with extrapolation.</p>
<p>There is a lot of nuance associated with these calculations, and it
is good to rely on software that focuses on this type of analysis. The
<a href="https://billdenney.github.io/pknca/" class="external-link">PKNCA</a> package has been developed with this in mind. The
ruminate app provides an interface to functionality found in
<a href="https://billdenney.github.io/pknca/" class="external-link">PKNCA</a> and will generate code you can use to get started
with <a href="https://billdenney.github.io/pknca/" class="external-link">PKNCA</a>.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="data-format">Data format<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-format"></a>
</h2>
<p>To run NCA you need your data formatted in a specific way. The names
of the columns can be defined by the user. Some columns are required,
others are optional, and others are only required depending on how the
user wants to specify dosing. See below for a general description of the
columns followed by more information about how dosing is inferred:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Subject ID:</strong> Unique id for each subject in the
dataset (required)</li>
<li>
<strong>Time:</strong> Observation time since the first dose
(required)</li>
<li>
<strong>Nominal Time:</strong> Time since the most recent dose
(optional, needed to determine dosing from columns)</li>
<li>
<strong>Dose:</strong> Amount of dose (required)</li>
<li>
<strong>Concentration:</strong> Observed concentration (NA for
missing values, required)</li>
<li>
<strong>Route:</strong> Dosing route (intravascular or
extravascular, required)</li>
<li>
<strong>Other Grouping:</strong> Other columns used for grouping
(optional)</li>
<li>
<strong>Dose Duration:</strong> Duration of infusion (optional)</li>
<li>
<strong>Dosing Cycle or Period:</strong> The most recent dose cycle
or period (optional, needed for dosing from columns)</li>
<li>
<strong>Event ID:</strong> EVID column from NONMEM used to
distinguish dosing and observation records (optional, needed for dosing
from rows)</li>
<li>
<strong>Analyte:</strong> Used if multiple analytes are present in
the dataset (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <strong>Dose</strong> and <strong>Concentration</strong>
need to have the same mass units.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="dosing-information">Dosing information<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dosing-information"></a>
</h3>
<p>Dosing will be extracted from the datasets, and it can be
incorporated in two ways. One is that the dosing information is stored
in columns of the dataset. This is the simplest and most straight
forward way of storing the dosing information. The other method is that
dosing is specified as individual records (rows) in the dataset (if your
data is formatted for NONMEM, you can use this).</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="determining-dosing-from-columns">Determining dosing from columns<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#determining-dosing-from-columns"></a>
</h4>
<p>Beyond the required columns to infer dosing from columns you must
also have the following columns defined: <strong>Dose</strong>,
<strong>Dosing Cycle or Period</strong>, and <strong>Nominal
Time</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="determining-dosing-from-rows-nonmem-format">Determining dosing from rows (NONMEM format)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#determining-dosing-from-rows-nonmem-format"></a>
</h4>
<p>If your dataset is formatted for NONMEM you can extract the dosing
from those rows that contain the dosing records. For this case it is
expected you will have the following columns in your dataset:
<strong>Dose</strong> (AMT in NONMEM) and <strong>Event ID</strong>
(EVID in NONMEM).</p>
<p>Some notes on dosing information. For each interval where you want to
calculate dose-dependent parameters, you will need to provide
information about dosing in those intervals. In a multiple dose setting
where you have intervals where you do not have enough PK data to run NCA
it, is not necessary to provide dosing information for those intervals.
For example if you have four weekly doses but only have intensive
sampling on weeks 1 and 4 but peak and trough on weeks 2 and 3, you do
not have to provide dosing information for weeks 2 and 3. However there
are certain parameters that <a href="https://billdenney.github.io/pknca/" class="external-link">PKNCA</a> will provide if that
dosing and intermediate sampling information is provided (e.g. time to
steady-state). So if all you are interested in is parameters for
intervals with intensive sampling, then you don’t need to worry about
having dosing information for the other intervals.</p>

<h3 id="nca-analysis-intervals">NCA analysis intervals<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nca-analysis-intervals"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you select an interval for analysis, it is necessary that you have
observations at the beginning and end of that interval. If you do not
have observations at dosing times (e.g. you dose at time zero but your
first observation is at 15 minutes post-dose) and you want to use the
dosing time as the beginning of your interval, you can have an
observation that is BQL or missing (<code>NA</code>) at the dosing time
(zero).</p>

  # This section contains information about different options, metadata about
  # them, default values, etc. Using this, the options UI for an analysis is
  # generated automatically. Each configuration option has the following:
  #
  # group        - This is how configuration options will be grouped in the app
  # label        - Short textual description
  # tooltip      - More detailed description of the option and what goes into it.
  #                Set to NULL to not display a tool tip.
  # type         - List of possible types. For example if you have "numeric" then
  #                "character" the value will be evaluated as numeric, if this is
  #                NA then it will be evaluated as character. Allowed types:
  #                  - numeric
  #                  - character
  #                  - mixed (numeric and character)
  #                  - logical (TRUE or FALSE)
  # value        - Default value in the UI
  # options      - If set to NULL a text input box will be created for this option,
  #                if there are options then a selection box will be created.
