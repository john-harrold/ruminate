  # This is a list of model sources. In the app the sources will be listed in
  # the order shown here.
  # possible sources:
  #   type: "library"
  #   name: "nlmixr2lib"
  sources:
  - source:
      type: "nlmixr2lib"
      name: "nlmixr2 Model Library"
# The include section is optional. You can use this section to copy files 
# from the directory where you are running the app to the user directory to be
# used in the app and when saved. The source and dest options can be a path
# command like below or a double
# quoted string: '"/path/to/file"'
# The dest should be relative to user directory (think the root of the zip
# file that is exported). See formods.yaml for examples.

# include:
#   files:
#   - file:
#       source: 'file.path(system.file(package="onbrand"), "templates", "report.docx")'
#       dest:   'file.path("config","report.docx")'
