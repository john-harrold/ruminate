# The MC field is a skeleton for constructing new modules
MC:
  # The prefix of object names created in the generated code
  element_object_name: "MB_obj"
  # This is a list of model sources. In the app the sources will be listed in
  # the order shown here. This is also referred to as the model catalog. If
  # the type is set to nlmixr2lib it will insert the models from nlmixr2lib.
  # User defined models can be used as well. See the examples below for
  # rxode2 and NONMEM models.
  # 
  # - group: This is how models will be grouped in the selection pulldown.
  # - name: Short name for the model: **NOTE that names need to be unique**.
  # - description: Verbose description of the model.
  # - type: Supported model types are "nlmixr2lib", "rxode2" or "NONMEM".
  # - obj: For the rxode2 type you need to also specify the name of the object 
  #   that is created. This option is only used for the rxode2 type.
  # - file: For both rxode2 and nlmixr2 you need to specify a character string 
  #   with a file path. This will be evaluated as an R command, so keep that 
  #   in mind. If the file is not found it will be skipped when the app loads.
